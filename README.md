# web_dev_projects
All things HTML, JavaScript, CSS

This repo contains projects related to web development.
The projects here are meant to be educational, fun and promote a general interest in computer science.

Please feel free to contribute and commit any changes with regards to improving, adding features or in general 
provide feedback to improve the overall quality of the project. As an educator I value the importance of learning as
much as we can.

Happy Coding!
